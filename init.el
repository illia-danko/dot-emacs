;; Personal Emacs Configuration.  Besides providing full-fledged editing
;; experience with minimal configuration, non main goals are:
;; 1) Booting Emacs fast;
;; 2) Modulate components by split into:
;; `core' for global settings,
;; `modes' for major modes,
;; `abbrevs' for abbreviations and
;; `ui' for better User Interface experience.
